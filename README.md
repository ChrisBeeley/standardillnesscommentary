## Introduction

This is a book all about my experiences with bowel and liver disease, and bowel and liver surgery. My organs all hang out and chat with each other in it. Some of them hate me and try to hurt me. My brain falls in love with my liver. It's all very dramatic. 

At the time of writing it is *very* rough, I'm just trying to get some raw material down ready to be tidied up into an actual book at a later stage.
