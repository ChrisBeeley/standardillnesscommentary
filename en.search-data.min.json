I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I\u0026rsquo;m always tired. But this is something else. Every cell in my body is screaming at me to just lie on the stairs on my face. The kids are in bed. My wife\u0026rsquo;s in bed. I could just stay here forever. At least until morning. I stand there for a long time. I\u0026rsquo;m not so tired that I can\u0026rsquo;t stand up, but I\u0026rsquo;m too tired to get up the stairs and placing my face on the tenth stair and just staying there is looking more and more attractive.\n\u0026ldquo;No. Chris. You are a black belt. You are not lying on the stairs on your face. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t even sound comfortable. GET UP THOSE STAIRS\u0026rdquo;.\nSlowly, this internal motivation monologue brings my limbs out of their stasis. Slowly I begin to ascend. Placing one foot in front of the other, I climb the stairs. I clean my teeth and go to bed.\nHow did I get here? How is it that a black belt with a pretty reasonable time in the half marathon set just eight years ago has to have a word with himself in order to climb the stairs at the end of the day? And how will I react when I\u0026rsquo;m cured of this disease and then struck down again with another, perhaps equally as debilitating?\nThis book is about a life milestoned by disease. A blessed life, with loving parents and, eventually, a wonderful family of my own, and a great education and fantastic job. But a life that has been pecked at by disease, worn down and damaged. And then, finally, a life complete, unimprovably good in every way.\nTOC (I will obviously move this, it\u0026rsquo;s for reference)       "},{"id":4,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"#standardillnesscommentary","content":""}]
