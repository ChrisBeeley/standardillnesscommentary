People often tell me to rest when I'm not feeling good. It's very kind of them, they associate rest, quite rightly, with getting better but of course it doesn't do anything in my case at all apart from just make me depressed.

I never tell my body to rest. This is for the simple reason that there is a day coming where it will tell me to rest, and when that day comes I won't be able to do anything but obey. For now I'm just keeping the lights on as long as I can
