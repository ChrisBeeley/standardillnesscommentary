## Welcome page

So, hello. Where to begin. My name is Chris Beeley. My pronouns are he/ him. I’m in the UK. I have a professional online presence that I’m not going to link to from here, and nor am I going to link to here from there. It’s not a secret, what I’m saying, what’s happening to me, and I’m not ashamed of it, but it’s my preference that there isn’t a direct link between the two worlds because this online presence is going to have a lot of stuff about sickness and pain and death in it and the other one... you know... won’t.

I’m 42 years old. I was diagnosed with chronic ulcerative colitis around the age of 11. I was so ashamed, it was this awful secret. Seems so funny now, these days I write stuff in the HuffPost about crapping in the bed, but I wasn’t the same person then as I am now.

Anyway, that was sort of bearable, and in my early twenties I was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis. It’s a degenerative liver disease and I was fine then. I worked, I ran marathons, I got my black belt. Things were good.

In 2014, aged 35, the wheels started to come off. My liver was seriously “deranged” and by the end of 2015 I was listed for a transplant. I might come back to the subject of life with end stage liver disease, I’m sure I will in fact. Spoiler alert: look after your liver. Trust me on that. It’s really, really, really important

I had a transplant May 2016 and then was back in hospital by September because my colon was kicking off. They had to take the whole thing out (August 2017) and give me an ileostomy. The took my spleen out too and I damn near bled to death. It was hideous (don’t worry if you go for a colectomy- they’re usually absolutely fine).

Then I was okay for a bit. I ran a sub 4 marathon which felt AMAZING. But by the end of 2019 my liver was packing up again (this time it’s hepatic arterial stenosis, a sometimes complication of liver transplant). They assessed me for another liver transplant, told me “yes, but not yet”, and then for no apparent reason I got better again.

Finally, in 2021 my liver has been packing up all over again, and I’m currently listed for another liver transplant.

Phew! You’re caught up! In the past I used to write a lot of stuff on Facebook about being ill, but for various reasons that I’m sure I will come back to I’ve very much gone off doing that. I’m sure I will link to this from there. People can read if they want.

If I’m going to get through this mentally OK (bearing in mind I was very much NOT okay in 2019) I need to understand my own mind, and if I need to understand I need to think, and if I think I need to write. So that’s what this is.
